An event where students came together to discuss the impact of AI on healthcare. Jurren de Groot and Yuxuan Zhu, master's students in Artificial Intelligence, took up the debate. They participated in SimuVaction, an event that brings students worldwide together in Atlanta to simulate an initiative of the G7, the Global Partnership on AI.

The topic of this simulation was inequalities in healthcare worldwide. The students therefore discussed social, economic and geographical factors that contribute to a lack of access to healthcare in some parts of the world. They first looked at the role of AI in healthcare. Then they came up with a plan on how AI can be used to improve problems.
